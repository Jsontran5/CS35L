The one from eggert's seem's to have an extra branch "remotes/origin/main".
Eggert's maint, next, seen, todo branch are not only listed as remote-tracking branches and are avaible as local branches since they dont have prefixes in them in the beginning of the name.
There is an extra "remotes/origin/main" branch is Eggert's repo.
All branches except master from Github are remote branches indicated with "remotes/origin/"
