1. (*  (expt 2 606) (- (expt 2 607) 1)) 
2. (+ (log (/ (* (expt 2 606) (- (expt 2 607) 1)) (expt 2 1000)) 2) 100)
3. When typing C-h k C-h k it runs the describe-key command on whatever is after the first C-h k. The command basically shows documentations and rules to the second command you inputted similar to what man does in linux. So it shows documentation to C-h k itself because you are using the C-h k on a command (C-h k in this case). This relates to C-h b because it lists command bindings and names so you can use C-h k on one to know what it does in detail.
4. When typing C-h k M-SPC it runs the describe-key command on meta space. So it shows the command documentation for the keybind M-SPC.M-SPC is the command for cycle spacing which is good for if you have a lot of whitespace and want to clean it up or delete it. It works by running the simpler cycle-spacing-actions many times.
5. cycle-spacing


Homework)
What happens when this script is invoked on an empty file like /dev/null, and why?
There is an error because the script uses sequences and indexing so it is accessing an index out of range since the file in empty.
What happens when this script is invoked with Python 3 rather than Python 2, and why? 
The script doesn’t work/compile since there is a syntax error. Python 3 is newer so it probably has new rules about syntax that do not apply to Python 2 which is the rules the script is currently following.

I get an error, more specifically ascii can’t decode a byte error when I use file.readlines(). The command is probably reading in lines that include characters that are not recognized on this version of python.


What happens when your shuf.py script is invoked with Python 2 rather than Python 3, and why? 
It doesn’t even run.
There is a syntax error concerning this line: print(f"shuf: invalid input range: '{lo}-{hi}'")
This is probably because python 3 is more lenient on single-quote and double-quote consecutively and python 2 doesn’t know how to deal with it yet, especially the format string also.
